This is a new feature that I have just added to the program. I am not sure if this will work, so I created another branch aside from the master branch called NewBranch.

After I am done with the new feature, I will try to run it to see if it executes successfully. If the program fails to run, I will correct it from this new branch until it works and merge it with my master branch.

Thanks and have fun!
