Hello! My name is Brian Cheong. I am a sophomore majoring in computer engineering. 
I have completed ECE 26300 during the Spring 2021 semester, and so I have some prior experiences in C programming language. 
I enrolled in this class primarily because it is a required course for my major, and secondly I have a deep interest in computer science courses. 
I am super excited to attend this class and I hope to start learning to work on projects as a real programmer.

Something interesting about myself is that I am a big fan of music and programming. 
I hope to get a job as a computer engineer by the time I graduate and acquire all the skills I need to succeed in this career.
My dream is to participate in a study abroad program and broaden my horizons by exploring a different culture.

Another fun fact about me, I am an international student from Malaysia. 
Studying in the US has always been a dream of mine since I was a kid, and I'm glad that I got the chance to attend college at IUPUI.
